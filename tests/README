Hi.

To build the ELFs, you need CrossPack:

https://www.obdev.at/products/crosspack/download.html

If those downloads don't work, you can find source on github:

https://github.com/obdev/CrossPack-AVR

Once you have avr-gcc, cd into one of these directories and type:

$> make

Feel free to modify these programs, just make sure to type

$> make clean

before you push to the repo.
